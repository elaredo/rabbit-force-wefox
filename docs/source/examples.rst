Examples
========

rabbit_force is very flexible. The
:doc:`configuration file's format </configuration>` makes it possible to cover a
wide range of use cases. This section contains several illustrated examples
of varying complexity to give you ideas how you can adapt rabbit_force for
your own use case.

Single source and sink
----------------------

.. image:: _static/examples/single_source_single_sink.svg

The configuration file below sets up rabbit_force to forward all event messages
from the Salesforce org ``my_org`` and from the PushTopic named
``lead_changes`` to a RabbitMQ broker named ``my_broker`` to the exchange
``my_exchange`` with the routing key of ``event_message``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    source:
      orgs:
        my_org:
          consumer_key: "<consumer_key>"
          consumer_secret: "<consumer_secret>"
          username: "<username>"
          password: "<password>"
          resources:
            - type: PushTopic
              spec:
                Name: lead_changes
                ApiVersion: 42.0
                NotifyForFields: Referenced
                NotifyForOperationCreate: true
                NotifyForOperationUpdate: true
                NotifyForOperationDelete: true
                NotifyForOperationUndelete: true
                Query: SELECT Id, Email, Name, Phone, MobilePhone, Status, LeadSource FROM Lead
    sink:
      brokers:
        my_broker:
          host: localhost
          exchanges:
            - exchange_name: my_exchange
              type_name: topic
              durable: true
    router:
      default_route:
        broker_name: my_broker
        exchange_name: my_exchange
        routing_key: event_message


Single source and sink with replay and routing rules
----------------------------------------------------

.. image:: _static/examples/single_source_single_sink_replay_routing.svg

The configuration file below sets up rabbit_force to forward all event messages
from the Salesforce org ``my_org`` and from the PushTopic named
``lead_changes`` to a RabbitMQ broker named ``my_broker`` to the exchange
``my_exchange``.

The routing keys of the forwarded messages depend on the event type property.
``created``, ``updated`` and ``deleted`` event messages are forwarded with
the routing keys ``lead.create``, ``lead.update`` and ``lead.delete``
respectively.

rabbit_force is also configured to use a `Redis <redis_>`_ database to store
replay markers, so it can take advantege of the Streaming API's
`message durability <replay_>`_ feature.

.. code-block:: yaml

    source:
      orgs:
        my_org:
          consumer_key: "<consumer_key>"

              durable: true
    router:
      default_route: null
      rules:
        - condition: "$[?(@.message.channel ~ '.*/lead_changes' & @.message.data.event.type = 'created')]"
          route:

            broker_name: my_broker
            exchange_name: my_exchange
            routing_key: lead.delete

Single source and sink with replay and complex routing rules
------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: _static/examples/single_source_single_sink_replay_complex_routing.svg

The configuration file below sets up rabbit_force to forward event messages
from the Salesforce org ``my_org`` and from the PushTopic named
``lead_changes`` to a RabbitMQ broker named ``my_broker`` to the exchange
``exchange1``, and forward event messages from the PushTopic
``contact_changes`` to the exchange ``exchange2``.

The routing keys of the forwarded messages depend on the event type property.
``created``, ``updated`` and ``deleted`` event messages from the PushTopic
``lead_changes`` are forwarded with the routing keys ``lead.create``,
``lead.update`` and ``lead.delete`` and from the PushTopic ``contact_changes``
they're forwarded with the routing keys of ``contact.create``,
``contanct.update`` and ``contact.delete`` respectively.

rabbit_force is also configured to use a `Redis <redis_>`_ database to store
replay markers, so it can take advantege of the Streaming API's
`message durability <replay_>`_ feature.
